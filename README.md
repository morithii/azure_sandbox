# Hi, I'm Morithi, an IT Professional â˜º

I've actively managed and implemented a series of technical projects using Microsoft Azure that have honed my skills in cloud infrastructure, networking, and system administration. Key projects include:

osTicket Implementation: Successfully deployed the osTicket help desk ticketing system on Azure, managing all aspects from initial setup to post-installation configurations and ticket lifecycle management. This project sharpened my abilities in application deployment and operational troubleshooting.

Active Directory on Azure VMs: Configured and maintained on-premises Active Directory on Azure Virtual Machines, leveraging Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10. This involved extensive use of Remote Desktop, Active Directory Domain Services, and PowerShell, enhancing my expertise in identity management and remote administration.

Network Security and Analysis: Conducted detailed network traffic analysis using Wireshark within an Azure environment, focusing on securing virtual networks with Network Security Groups and analyzing protocols like SSH, RDP, and HTTPS. This experience advanced my skills in network security and traffic management on both Windows and Linux platforms (Ubuntu Server 20.04).

These initiatives have provided me with robust practical experience in managing Azure-based solutions, optimizing compute resources, and ensuring network security, positioning me well for advanced roles in cloud services and infrastructure management.
